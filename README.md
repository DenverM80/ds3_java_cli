ds3_java_cli
============

## Install

To install the latest ds3_java_cli download the latest release(either a zip or tar) from the [Releases](../../releases) page.  Inside of the release download there is a `bin` directory and a `lib` directory.  The `bin` directory contains all the excutable files for both Linux and Windows.  The `lib` directory contains all the jar files that are needed for the cli.  The only external dependency is the latest [Java 7 or 8 JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

## Usage

After the release bundle has been extracted you can then execute `bin/ds3_java_cli -h` on Linux or `bin/ds3_java_cli.bat -h` on Windows to get the help menu.
